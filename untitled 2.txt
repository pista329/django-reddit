Problem with positioning LUNA 220
- absolute for MessageList View

Problem with attachments blinking - ReactSwipe rerender
- initial attachments from messages vs. making request each time when opening

Problem with sidebar:
 - blur effect only for safari
 - my settings are as sidebar and also have tabbar on mobile
  - perhaps moving as center screen in the future



Problem with transitions:
- react-router-transition (react--motion) did not work, duplicated sidebar
<RouteTransition
    pathname={location.pathname}
    atEnter={{ opacity: 0 }}
    atLeave={{ opacity: 0 }}
    atActive={{ opacity: 1 }}
  >

- react-transition-group did not work because animation events were not triggered (example of AnimatedSwitch at https://github.com/mhaagens/animated_routes_react)
